## Unity_ProjectRED
Project RED is a commercial game developed by my team of 4 as a 7-month long assignment for course COSC 4358/4359 at the University of Houston. I formed, coordinated, and taught the team in which my roles include Team Lead, Producer, Lead Programmer, and Animator. Upon completion, the game will be also be used to compete in the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition in 2017.

Project RED is a 2D puzzle platformer focused on clever puzzle design paired with modern mechanics. Of those modern mechanics, our hook is the ability to switch between timelines. By being able to switch between timelines at will, puzzles pieces can be layered and separated between timelines. This will challenge the player and require good use of their critical thinking.

By the end of Spring 2017, our game has placed national semi-finals at the 2017 Microsoft Imagine Cup. Moreover, our game was the only game that received scoring of 90+ across the board during our public demo showcasing collaboration event with the Houston Art Institution and UH.
